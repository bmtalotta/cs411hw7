to run this code use main.cpp, convexhull.cpp, and convexhull.hpp
main currently is set up to run both a divide and conquer convexhull and a brute force convext hull on a set of 100 points.
it then outputs the hull values, and outputs the time to run each in microseconds.
the convexhull.cpp and convexhull hpp can be used for any vector<pair<int,int>> data.
